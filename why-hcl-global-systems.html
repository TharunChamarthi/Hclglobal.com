            <h4>Provide IT consulting, customized solutions and products by creating an environment conducive to
                excellence in growth of knowledge.</h4>
            <hr size="5" color="red" width="82%">
            <p>Delivering competitiveness is what HCL Global Systems brings to the table when it takes on any
                assignment. Its vast repertoire of competencies begin from strategy consulting, that factors in the
                client’s current and future competitive scenario, and then goes on to tailor IT solutions and services
                that meets today’s as well as tomorrow’s business needs. The skill-set of HCL Global Systems span key
                verticals and cuts a swathe across those with a sweep of horizontal solutions an enviable list of loyal
                clients, who have regularly sought our services, are living proof of the HCL Global Systems edge. It is
                their testimonials and our growing list of competencies that is helping to enlarge the list of clients
                every day.</p>

            <h4>Streamlining Process with IT</h4>
            <hr size="5" color="red" width="38%">
            <p id="common">Every business is a blend of processes that need to work in tandem for overall success. With
                companies getting larger and more fragmented in a distributed business space, the binding factor is
                information. Information Systems that underlie each process must all “talk” to each other seamlessly to
                achieve their business goals. HCL Global Systems enables companies to effectively synchronize process
                and information systems to optimize their operational efficiencies.

            </p>

            <h4>Managing IT Enabled Processes</h4>
            <hr size="5" color="red" width="43%">
            <p id="common"> It’s important for businesses to recognize and focus on their core competencies, to achieve
                maximum efficiency in areas that bring revenue. Companies that do not possess the competency to manage
                IT optimally, end up losing both in terms of quality of business process, time and efficiency-and in the
                long run, the bottom line suffer. Out-sourcing IT tasks to professionals can free up the company’s
                resources to concentrate on the main line of business. HCL Global Systems helps companies focus on their
                respective core competencies by taking up the IT implementation aspect in which it has expertise.</p>

            <h4>Placing IT in the Picture</h4>
            <hr size="5" color="red" width="32%">
            <p id="common"> If businesses are to successfully leverage today’s opportunities and meet business
                challenges head on, they need to make Information Technology an integral part of their operations. For
                some, this implies harnessing the power of technology to design and build better products. For others,
                it means using information systems to improve relationships with suppliers and customers. For all, it
                means using IT-driven processes to make internal operations smoother and more effective. HCL Global
                Systems’ consulting services help business see where IT fits into their scheme, while our design and
                implementation teams take the concept into action.

            </p>

            <h4>Managing People up to Speed with IT
            </h4>
            <hr size="5" color="red" width="50%">
            <p>
            This is a challenge every company faces in the course of time. HCL Global Systems has made it simpler for
            companies to focus on their Core Business and Strategic decisions, taking away from the customer the more
            routine, but nonetheless, and important job of maintaining their legacy systems. Since HCL Global Systems
            has gained tremendous experience over the years in maintaining legacy systems for major Fortune 500
            customers, it has chalked out a distinct road map in terms of turnaround time, cost savings and resource
            mobilization, among the many other parameters for successful out-sourcing of mission-critical applications.

            </p>

            <h4>Bringing People up to Speed with IT
            </h4>
            <hr size="5" color="red" width="48%">
            <p>
            HCL Global Systems’ vast resource base of technically qualified and trained manpower brings the advantage of
            prime intellectual property apart from savings in time and money. HCL Global Systems also applies its
            process approach to free up the customer’s intellectual property (i.e. people) for better tasks. This not
            only adds value to the customer, but also helps retain the volatile human resource with the incentive of
            working on better technologies and bringing them up to speed with new technologies affecting the customer’s
            industry.
            </p>

            <h4>Integration Process and Technology
            </h4>
            <hr size="5" color="red" width="48%">
            <p>
            HCL Global Systems believes that in order to build a sustainable technology infrastructure, enterprises need
            to have a strong process framework in place. HCL Global Systems embraced the “quality” movement well ahead
            of its time, putting in place well-defined processes, which help introduce and implement new technology
            initiatives within an Organization in a less disruptive manner. HCL Global Systems’ on-going effort is to
            bring our experience with creating process excellence to our customers.
            </p>

            <h4>Optimizing IT Resources
            </h4>
            <hr size="5" color="red" width="33%">
            <p>
            HCL Global Systems has constantly endeavored to optimize the technology operations of the customer be it
            cost savings, qualitative deliverables on time, or quick response in production and application support.
            This allows customers and their technology teams to focus on more critical and value-adding technology
            tasks. This also gives the customer more time and space to consider the implications of adopting
            new-technology for business and focus on relationships with the customers, suppliers, and employees. In
            other words, the customers gain the time and energy to focus on critical and core strategic and tactical
            decisions, while HCL Global Systems handles the operational management of the technology.


            </p>

            <h4>Creating Better Business Value
            </h4>
            <hr size="5" color="red" width="41%">
            <p>
            While HCL Global Systems takes on the operational responsibility for managing the applications, it also
            helps the customer save cost and increase the time to market with a 24-hour cycle time in addressing the
            project or product requirements. In addition, HCL Global Systems also addresses different dimensions of the
            customer’s problems, by applying its vast experience in multiple projects across industries and
            technologies, in a variety of business cultures. HCL Global Systems has the capability to bring a fresh
            perspective on existing problems, streamlining the customer’s overall business process, in the course of the
            engagement, to enhance business value for the customer.

            <h4>Enabling E-Commerce
            </h4>
            <hr size="5" color="red" width="30%">
            <p>
